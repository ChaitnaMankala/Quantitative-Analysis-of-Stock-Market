# Quantitative Analysis of Stock Market

## Overview
Quantitative Analysis in the stock market involves the use of mathematical and statistical techniques to analyze, predict, and make informed decisions about financial investments. This project demonstrates the process of performing Quantitative Analysis on stock market data using Python, including descriptive statistics, time series analysis, volatility analysis, correlation analysis, and risk-return trade-off analysis.

## Features
- **Descriptive Statistics**: Provides summary statistics like mean, median, standard deviation, and more for stock prices.
- **Time Series Analysis**: Visualizes trends and patterns in stock closing prices over time.
- **Volatility Analysis**: Calculates and compares stock price fluctuations to identify volatility.
- **Correlation Analysis**: Examines the relationships between the closing prices of different stocks.
- **Comparative Analysis**: Compares percentage changes in stock prices over a specified period.
- **Risk vs. Return Analysis**: Evaluates daily returns and their associated risks for each stock.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains historical stock market data, including:
- **Ticker**: Stock ticker symbol (e.g., AAPL, MSFT, etc.)
- **Date**: Trading date
- **Open**: Opening price of the stock for the day
- **High**: Highest price of the stock during the day
- **Low**: Lowest price of the stock during the day
- **Close**: Closing price of the stock for the day
- **Adj Close**: Adjusted closing price (accounts for corporate actions)
- **Volume**: Number of shares traded during the day

## Project Workflow
### 1. Descriptive Statistics
Generates summary statistics for each stock in the dataset to provide insights into stock behavior.
### 2. Time Series Analysis
Plots the time series of closing prices to identify trends and patterns for each stock.
### 3. Volatility Analysis
Calculates and compares the standard deviation of closing prices to assess stock price fluctuations.
### 4. Correlation Analysis
Creates a heatmap to visualize the correlation between the closing prices of different stocks.
### 5. Comparative Analysis
Calculates percentage changes in closing prices over the observed period to compare stock performance.
### 6. Risk vs. Return Analysis
Plots risk (standard deviation of daily returns) vs. average daily returns to evaluate the trade-off for each stock.

## Visualizations
### 1. Time Series Analysis
Visualize trends and patterns of stock closing prices over time.
### 2. Volatility Analysis
Bar chart depicting the standard deviation of closing prices for each stock.
### 3. Correlation Analysis
Heatmap displaying correlations between stock closing prices.
### 4. Risk vs. Return Analysis
Scatter plot showing the relationship between risk and average daily return for each stock.

## Results
1. **Descriptive Statistics**: Statistical summaries for stock closing prices.
2. **Volatility**: NFLX exhibits the highest volatility, while GOOG shows the least.
3. **Correlation**: Positive correlations observed between several stocks (e.g., AAPL and MSFT).
4. **Risk vs. Return**: AAPL shows the lowest risk with a positive daily return, while MSFT balances moderate risk and return.
